    "# HTML and CSS - Parsing Markup\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML is the semantic structure of a website and is composed of elements denoted by specific tags. A tag looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<tagname>tag content</tagname>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tags usually have opening and closing tags, with the `/` being used to indicate the closing tag. This marks the end of the tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p>I'm a paragraph</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements can also be self closing - the image element technically does not need a closing tag\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<img src=\"https://some.url/coolimage.jpg\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of tags, and they all have different semantic meaning ([you can read more here](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/html-5-semantics/)). However, their implementation varies and there is no universally used standard when building websites. Below are some widely used versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `p`: paragraph of text\n",
    "* `a`: a link\n",
    "* `ul`: an unordered (bulleted) list\n",
    "* `li`: a list item\n",
    "* `strong`: important text (typically displays bold)\n",
    "* `h1` through `h6`: heading levels 1 through 6 \n",
    "* `div`: a widely used tag used to signify a division or section of content\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that of all these tags, the `div` tag is a \"pure\" container and does not inherently represent anything semantically. Typically it is used in order to apply styling with CSS, which we will cover later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes are extra bits of information that appear inside the opening tag - their values sit inside quotation marks. These values configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<tagname attributename=\"value\">tag content</tagname>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some attributes are specific to certain tags, while others can be applied to any tag. We will look at the two most important such attributes for our purposes - `id` and `class`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `id` attribute gives a **unique** id to a tag. This tag is traditionally used for accessing elements with javascript. There can only be **one** tag with any given `id`. We'll soon see why this level of specificity is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `class` attribute is primarily used for styling elements. Multiple tags of different type can share the same class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<ul id=\"the_list\">\n",
    "    <li class=\"list_element\">The data we want</li>\n",
    "    <li class=\"list_element\">The data we want</li>\n",
    "    <li class=\"list_element\">The data we want</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some attributes are specific to certain tags. This includes the image element's `src` tag which is a link to the image URL\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<img src=\"https://some.url/coolimage.jpg\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This also includes the `a` tag's `href` link, which indicates where the browser should navigate to when interacted with.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<a href=\"https://mycoollink.com\">check out my cool link</a>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Webpage Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Most webpage documents contain the following tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `html`: This surrounds the entire document\n",
    "* `head`: Contains the title and other information such as links to style sheets and javascript. It does not render any visible content.\n",
    "* `title`: The title of the page shown in the browser tab\n",
    "* `body`: Contains all visible elements on the website\n",
    "\n",
    "An example HTML document:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>Some website with data</title>\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>\n",
    "        <p>Please do not scrape this well formatted data</p>\n",
    "        \n",
    "        <ul>\n",
    "            <li>beautiful</li>\n",
    "            <li>delicious</li>\n",
    "            <li>data</li>\n",
    "        </ul>\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML Elements are nested within each other, indicating heirarchy. The indentations are optional but help to visually indicate the inherent heirarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the Chrome inspector \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Chrome developer tools to inspect our web pages, but Firefox, Safari, and Edge also have developer tools you can use. Chrome and Firefox are generally well regarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Isolating elements with query selector\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS is applied to html elements using query selectors - we will use the same to select HTML elements in python.\n",
    "[Read more here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)"

    "Covering the basics of web scraping with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Python's standard library to scrape the web and there are also a number of other packages available for scraping in Python and other languages, but we will use `requests-html` due to its ease of use.\n",
